- Added macros to compare rectangles, regions, locations, colors etc.
- Added diagonal cursor keys.
- Added more types to the auto generated "directfb_strings.h".
- Added DFBVertex containing transformed x, y, z, w, s and t coordinates.
- Added DSCAPS_DOUBLE and changed DSCAPS_FLIPPING to be a
  combination of DSCAPS_DOUBLE and DSCAPS_TRIPLE.

- Added DFXL_DRAWSTRING for IDirectFBSurface::GetAccelerationMask().
- Added prefix "ret_" to all output parameters.
- Added DFBSpan containing x and width of a span.
- When specified use the pixelformat of the surface description
  to create a windowed primary surface.
- Added DFB_VERSIONMISMATCH and DFB_NOSHAREDMEMORY error codes.
- Added DFBInsets specifying a distance from each
  edge of a rectangle: left, top, right, bottom.
- Added DLCAPS_SOURCES which indicates that the layer supports multiple 
  sources that can be selected, e.g. from frame buffer (surface) or from
  hardware decoders (using buffers outside of the frame buffer).
- Added DFBDisplayLayerSourceID with pre-defined DLSID_SURFACE.
- Added number of supported sources to DFBDisplayLayerDescription.
- Added DFBDisplayLayerSourceDescription containing the ID and a name.
- Added DLCONF_SOURCE along with a field in DFBDisplayLayerConfig to
  select the source to be used.

API | IDirectFB
- Added IDirectFB::EnumScreens() and IDirectFB::GetScreen().

API | IDirectFBEventBuffer
- Added IDirectFBEventBuffer::CreateFileDescriptor() returning a file
  descriptor that can be read from, including support for select().

API | IDirectFBDisplayLayer
- Added IDirectFBDisplayLayer::GetScreen().
- Moved IDirectFBDisplayLayer::SetScreenPowerMode()
  to IDirectFBScreen, called SetPowerMode().

API | IDirectFBScreen
- New interface IDirectFBScreen for mixer, encoder and output settings.
- An output is connected to an encoder which is connected to a mixer which
  combines selected display layers.
- Added a lot of types for description and configuration of these components.
  (see the API Reference Manual for more details)

API | IDirectFBSurface
- Added IDirectFBSurface::TextureTriangles() using a surface as the texture,
  a pointer to a DFBVertex array, an optional index array, the array size and
  the DFBTriangleFormation which can be DTTF_LIST, DTTF_STRIP or DTTF_FAN.
- Added IDirectFBSurface::BatchBlit() which increases pixel throughput  
  of many small blits with same source and destination, e.g. custom font
  rendering like GTK+-DirectFB does.
- Preliminary depth buffer support using DSCAPS_DEPTH to allocate and use it,
  currently hard coded to 16 bit, only useful for TextureTriangles().
- Added DSFLIP_PIPELINE for advanced synchronization with the accelerator,
  currently implemented for Flip() on window surfaces. This feature is for
  accelerators with a command buffer that can store more graphics operations
  than required to render one frame.
- Added IDirectFBSurface::FillSpans() which is passed a DFBSpan array.

Runtime Options
- Added "force-desktop" to run fullscreen applications in the background.
- Added "a1-font" to force usage of monochrome fonts (FreeType2).
- Added "linux-input-ir-only" which tells the linux input driver
  to ignore all non-IR Linux Input devices.
- Added "wm=<wm>" to select the window manager module to use.
- Added "[no-]trace".
- Users can enable/disable debug output separately,
  e.g. using "no-debug,debug=direct,no-debug=direct/memcpy".
- Added "vt-switching" which is enabled by default.
- Added "no-vt" which disables usage of VT code completely.
- Added "no-decorations" to disable automatic window decorations
  of the "UniQuE" window manager implementation.

- Added "--enable-zlib" that activates gzipped screen shots etc.
- Added "--enable-voodoo", default is no.
- V4L2 has to be enabled explicitly via "--enable-video4linux2".
- Detect cygwin, default to static builds and don't require libdl.
- In static build mode, add an ".o" version of the ".a" module file.
  Applications can link statically against the ".o" files without having
  to specify an extra linker option for each module, e.g. "-Wl,-udirectfb_sdl".
- Applied patch from "Oskar Liljeblad <oskar@osk.mine.nu>"   
  which adds the configure option "--disable-sonypi-jogdial".
- Added "--disable-wm97xx" to disable WM97xx driver.
- With "--disable-gettid" one can enforce usage of getpid(),
  e.g. on broken systems where gettid() simply segfaults,
  though the system call is present in <linux/unistd.h>.
- Added "--enable-unique", disabled by default.

Pixel Formats
- Added DSPF_AiRGB, i.e. DSPF_ARGB with inverted alpha channel.
- Added DSPF_A1, e.g. for monochrome fonts.
- Removed DSPF_RGB15 in the flavor of DSPF_ARGB1555.
- Added DFB_COLOR_BITS_PER_PIXEL(format), DFB_ALPHA_BITS_PER_PIXEL(format)
  and DFB_PIXELFORMAT_INV_ALPHA(format).
- Added DFB_PIXELFORMAT_ALIGNMENT(format) which is non-zero if alignment
  is required to do byte aligned access, e.g. 7 for DSPF_A1.
- Added DSPF_NV12 (planar YUV).
  (8 bit Y plane followed by one 16 bit quarter size CbCr [15:0] plane)
- Added DSPF_NV16 (planar YUV).
  (8 bit Y plane followed by one 16 bit half width CbCr [15:0] plane)

System
- Use gettid() instead of getpid() if available.

Graphics Core
- Minimize state changes during text drawing.
- Drivers can choose between byte/pixel pitch alignment, or even use both.
- Added convenience macros and inline functions for setting state members.
- Added CoreGraphicsSerial storing the "serial" of a certain graphics operation.
- Added GetSerial() and WaitSerial() to the graphics driver API:
  GetSerial() returns the serial of the last queued graphics operation.
  WaitSerial() waits until the operation with the specified serial is finished.
- Store the serial of the most recent accelerated graphics operation that has
  been queued for writing to a surface buffer.
- dfb_layer_region_flip_update() is no longer waiting for an idle accelerator, 
  if the buffer that is becoming the front has or had a write operation queued.
  Instead it waits exactly for the last operation that is or was about to write
  to this buffer. If WaitSerial() is not supported by the driver and/or hardware,
  the fallback, of course, is to wait for each and every operation to finish.
- Wait for only the last write operation queued for a buffer,
  if the software needs to access it.
- Speed up tiled blitting by clipping in advance.
- Implemented software clipping for hardware accelerated DrawRectangle().
- Use hardware accelerated FillRectangle() if DrawRectangle() is not accelerated.
- Removed the surface listeners attached by dfb_state_set_destination() and  
  dfb_state_set_source().
- Added dfb_state_update() which does the work of the removed listeners
  if direct_serial_update() returns true. Updating the source is optional.
  Only surfaces set via dfb_state_set_*() are handled.
- Use dfb_state_update() in dfb_gfxcard_state_acquire() and gAcquire().
- Added parameter "write_front" to dfb_surface_flip_buffers() which is useful  
  for triple buffering. If true, the new back buffer will be the front buffer. 
  Drivers should detect if the current front buffer is not being shown already,
  in which case the idle buffer might be still shown and should not be written.
- Added "__u32 dfb_color_to_aycbcr( const DFBColor *color )".

Display Layer Core
- Refactored display layer core.
- Added contexts along with regions allocated within them.
- Drivers are only aware of regions. Usually a driver supports one region
  per layer. Hardware windows are implemented via hardware regions.

Input Core
- Added dfb_input_add_global() and dfb_input_set_global() to register global 
  reactions at run time, e.g. from another library or module in which case the   
  static reaction table can't be initialized with the address of those functions.
- Cleaned up input core code, e.g. by replacing the "inlined" singly linked list
  code by using a "DirectLink" and the "direct_list_*()" functions, or by adding
  usage of D_MAGIC_ASSERT() etc.

Windowing Core
- Pressing <Meta>-<Ctrl> + Left/Right Click generates 3rd/4th button event.
- Switch to color keyed cursor if shape doesn't have alpha or if translucent
  windows are disabled.
- Changed <Meta>-'S' to raise the lowest window, e.g. to revert a <Meta>-'A'.
- Added <Meta>-<Escape> to switch from fullscreen mode to the desktop.
  (currently not advisable if a flipping fullscreen app is still rendering)
- Modularized window management for different implementations on desktop
  and embedded systems.
- Added new experimental window manager "UniQuE" with window decorations.
- Added a CoreWindowConfig containing position, size, opacity, stacking,
  options, events, color key and opaque region.

Software Driver
- Added DSBLIT_DEINTERLACE support to gBlit.
- Implemented missing blending modes.
- Implemented lots of missing format specific code.
- Implemented stretchblitting for YUV.
- Fix a8 font rendering for argb1555, i.e. remove alpha pits around glyphs.
- Replaced gDrawLine() by gFillRectangle() in rectangle outline drawing code.
- Allocate accumulators dynamically.
- Lots of optimizations and fixes.

Debugging Support
- Major speed up by using thread specific data instead of gettid().
- Use popen("nm -n ...") to load symbols of any module on demand.
- Show static symbols in stack traces.
- Produce gdb like stack dumps (output formatting).
- Added thread names to debug output, stack traces etc.
- Added interface instance tracking in debug mode, showing remaining
  instances at exit time (like it's done for allocated memory).
- Added debug domains which can be enabled/disabled separately.
- Added "<Meta>-<BackSpace>" debugging shortcut for
  dumping the stack of each thread of the master process.
- Align debug output of domains.
- Indent debug output if trace support is enabled
  by using direct_trace_debug_indent() which sets the flag TF_DEBUG for the
  current frame and returns the current debug message indention level by
  examining the stack, counting any upper frames that produced debug output.
- Added tons of assertions and assumption, mostly to new code.
- Added support for A8,YUY2 and UYVY surfaces in dfb_surface_dump().

Fixes (excerpt)
- No need to call SetOpacity() before RequestFocus() for input only windows.
- Don't allow GetWindow() on the cursor window.
- Don't wait for Fusion Dispatch Thread during emergency shutdown.
- Fixed missing MMX initialization in slaves, only the master used MMX before.
- Use RTLD_NOW to detect undefined symbols before the module is used at all.

libdirect
- Migrated base functionality (threads, signals, interfaces, debugging,
  lists, modules etc.) into a separate library that can even be used by apps.
- Added direct_clock_set_start() that is called by Fusion's initialization
  to synchronize time stamps of debug messages.
- Added a minimalistic hash table implementation for usage with IDs as keys.
- Added DirectResult which is the DFBResult outside of DirectFB.
- Added message macro D_UNIMPLEMENTED which prints a warning once.
- Added a name argument to direct_thread_create(),
  printed during creation and termination of threads.

  and direct_thread_self_name().
- Added DIRECT_UTIL_RECURSIVE_PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER.
- Added direct_list_append() and changed the list structure to have
  the first element's 'prev' pointing to the last element of the list.
- Added DirectThreadInitHandler which can be installed/uninstalled using   
  direct_thread_add_init_handler() and direct_thread_remove_init_handler().
  The registered init handler function is called at the beginning of new threads.
- Allow per file debug mode forcing via definition of DIRECT_FORCE_DEBUG.
- Added D_DERROR(ret,message) which acts like D_PERROR(message), but takes
  a DirectResult (DFBResult) instead of using errno.
- Added D_ARRAY_SIZE(array) to calculate the size of an array.
- Added D_FORMAT_PRINTF(n) to check the format of (debug) messages.
- Added flag manipulation macros D_FLAGS_*.
- Added D_CONST_FUNC to declare const functions.
- Added DirectSerial providing a 64 bit serial number with functions
  for initialization, increasing, copying and updating.
- Added D_DEBUG_ENABLED which is defined depending on three other macros.
  It's defined to be 1, if the D_DEBUG* macros produce code. Useful for
  embracing code that is just required for the debugging output.
- Added D_OOM() which prints the warning "out of memory" and gives
  DFB_NOSYSTEMMEMORY if used as a (return) value.
- Added D_OOSHM() which is the same as D_OOM() in single app build.
  Only in multi app build it prints the warning "out of shared memory"
  and gives DFB_NOSHAREDMEMORY if used as a (return) value.
- Renamed direct_list_contains() to direct_list_contains_element_EXPENSIVE()
  to ensure that developers know that they shouldn't use it in non-debug code.
- Added direct_list_count_elements_EXPENSIVE().
- Added direct_util_count_bits(), slow version,
  but at least optimized for bit sets with lower bits set only.

libfusion
- Migrated Fusion into a separate library to be used without DirectFB,
  e.g. using FusionSound without initializing DirectFB.
- Added fusion_object_globalize() doing the often used combination of
  fusion_object_link() and fusion_object_unref(), i.e. increasing the global
  reference counter and decreasing the local reference counter.
- Removed FusionResult using DirectResult instead.
- Use new Fusion API for entering the world (including version checking).
- Added fusion_ref_inherit() using the new ioctl FUSION_REF_INHERIT.
- Added fusion_object_inherit() to inherit the local reference count
  from another object of any type.
- Added "docs/ReferenceMaps.txt" which explains references
  and visualizes different cases of inter object referencing.
- Heavily cleaned up code of FusionReactor and added lots of debug messages and
  comments. You should add "no-debug = fusion/reactor" to disable these loads
  of debug messages, while still showing other messages if "debug" is used.
- Cleaned up FusionObject code and debug messages.
- Added some assertions and assumptions to the shared memory code.
- Added a parameter to fusion_skirmish_init() and fusion_reactor_init() to  
  set the name of the skirmish or reactor using the ioctl FUSION_ENTRY_SET_INFO.
- Don't create a skirmish for each reactor's global reactions, but use a single
  skirmish for all reactors which is created during Fusion's initialization.
- Added fusion_reactor_set_lock() to use another skirmish for the global
  reactions of the reactor.
- Added fusion_object_set_lock() to set the skirmish for the global reactions
  of the object's reactor, while default is the skirmish used to lock the pool.

- Added IDirectFBEventBuffer::WakeUp() causing any WaitForEvent() or
  WaitForEventWithTimeout() to return with DFB_INTERRUPTED.
- Added new display layer buffer mode DLBM_WINDOWS where the layer itself
  has no surface, but the hardware is aware of each window and displays
  the window stack. Added DLCAPS_WINDOWS, too.
- Added <Meta>-<Print> hot key to make a screenshot of the focused window
  including its alpha channel if present. Creates a ppm (RGB) and a pgm (alpha).
  Use "pnmtopng -alpha foo.pgm foo.ppm > foo.png" to combine them.
- Added IDirectFBSurface::Dump() similar to <Meta>-<Print>, see above.

------

- Initial version of a Radeon DirectFB driver featuring solid drawing/filling
  and simple blitting with or without key by Michel Dänzer <michel@daenzer.net>.
- Added VT switching support which has to be enabled via option "vt-switching".
  It's pretty well working already, though there are some minor issues left.
- Added support for multiple multi application worlds with new option
  "session=<num>" selecting the multi application world being joined or created.
  VT switching between multiple DirectFB sessions rocks!

  the window from alpha blending, e.g. for blended borders around fast opaque
  content. This is especially useful if the content has no valid alpha values.
- Added DWOP_OPAQUE_REGION which enables the opaque region.
- Made all unsigned width, height in the API signed.
- Made text drawing honor DSDRAW_BLEND flag to render translucent text.
- Added Intel i810 driver from Tony Daplas < adaplas at users.sourceforge.net >.

  window's event queue. The event dispatcher thread can then decide to close it.
- Added 'IDirectFBWindow::Destroy()' which actually destroys the window after
  sending a 'DWET_DESTROYED' event, so the event dispatcher thread can notice
  and release any interfaces belonging to it.
