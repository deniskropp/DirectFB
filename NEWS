0.9.24
------

- Added missing source (header) files to their appropriate Makefile.am, mostly from voodoo.
- Don't use fusion_reactor_free() too early in case of an error in init_devices().
  Thanks to "Jakub Bogusz <qboosh@pld-linux.org>" for this and other patches.
- IDirectFBVideoProvider::GetPos() returns DFB_EOF to notify end-of-playback.
  After stream has reached the end, the next call to PlayTo() restarts playback from the beginning.
- No need for <linux/wm97xx.h> and <linux/sisfb.h> anymore.
- Build all graphics drivers without checking for FB_ACCEL_* in <linux/fb.h>,
  because we have a fallback for each of those ids.
- Don't build cle266 by default as it's obsolete because of the unichrome driver.


0.9.23
------

Authors
- Added "Claudio Ciccani <klan82@cheapnet.it>" to main authors,
  welcome number five and thanks for your appreciated work :-)

API
- Added IDirectFBSurface::DisableAcceleration( DFBAccelerationMask mask ).
- Added DSBLIT_SRC_PREMULTCOLOR which modulates the source color with the
  color alpha value only.
- Replaced IDirectFB::GetCardCapabilities() by GetDeviceDescription()
  and DFBCardCapabilities by DFBGraphicsDeviceDescription which contains
  additional information like device and driver name, version etc.
- Added more enums to the autogenerated directfb_strings.h.
- Added errorcode DFB_EOF.
- Added DSBLIT_XOR.
- Added universal event class for custom usage with variable size. New structure DFBUniversalEvent
  has a 'clazz' and a 'size' member. The clazz is always DFEC_UNIVERSAL and the size is at least
  sizeof(DFBUniversalEvent). There are no other members, but any amount of additional data may
  follow according to the specified size. Best usage would be to derive from the struct.
- Added new input event flag DIEF_REPEAT indicating a repeated key or button press.
- Support fractional font sizes in DFBFontDescription.
- Added IDirectFBDataBuffer::CreateVideoProvider().
- Added IDirectFBDataBuffer::Finish(): used to notify a streaming databuffer that the end-of-file has been reached.

Runtime Options
- Fixed pixelformat=NV21 option.
- Added option 'busid' to specify the graphics card bus id (unused if sysfs support is enabled).

Build Options
- Allow predefinition of FREETYPE_CFLAGS and FREETYPE_LIBS outside of configure.
- New configure option "--with-sysroot=DIR" lets you prepend a path to the runtime library/module paths.

Graphics Core
- Added support for system to video memory blits in (semi-)hardware.
- Some 24bit big endian fixes, thanks to Mark Salter <msalter@redhat.com>!
- Added dfb_gfxcard_invalidate_state() which sets the state pointer to NULL
  and therefore forces a full SetState() before the next operation is executed.
- If the destination has premultiplied alpha do real Porter/Duff SRC_OVER
  composition for glyphs.
- Fixed build_clipped_rectangle_outlines() to handle special cases
  where width and/or height is/are one or two.
- Take into consideration DSDRAW_DST_COLORKEY and DSDRAW_XOR when drawing strings.
- Added RGB332 and LUT8 support to dfb_surface_dump().
- Fixed artifacts produced by clipped triangles, thanks to Damian Kowalewski <damian.kowalewski@mail.mcgill.ca>!

Layer & Screen Core
- Fixed missing updates to the hardware state under some circumstances.
- It's allowed to create and use windows in exclusive mode, showing the own windows only, of course.
- Changed EnableCursor() to be allowed in exclusive mode, too.
- Added dfb_screens_hook_primary() using it in some drivers instead of dfb_screen_register_primary().
- During flip using blitting, wait for pending writes to the back buffer before issuing
  the blit command from back to front buffer to avoid lags caused by too much queued commands.

Windowing Core
- Support windows with premultiplied alpha by checking if their surface has DSCAPS_PREMULTIPLIED.
- Support premultiplied cursor shapes.
- If during window creation the pixel format for windows with an alpha channel is
  unspecified, don't always take DSPF_ARGB, but the layer's format if it has alpha.

Software Rasterizer
- Fixed inverted YV12 colors.
- Changed Bop_a8_set_alphapixel_Aop_argb() to be a fast path for real SRC_OVER
  DrawString() that uses DSBLIT_SRC_PREMULTIPLY and DSBLIT_BLEND_ALPHACHANNEL
  with SrcBlend = ONE and DstBlend = INVSRCALPHA. Other formats will follow.
- Fixed DSDRAW_SRC_PREMULTIPLY if used without blending.
- Implemented DSBLIT_SRC_PREMULTCOLOR.
- Added optimization for drawing blended with Src = ONE, Dst = ZERO.
- Improved Dacc_YCbCr_to_RGB_MMX.
- Fixed A8 to A8 font rendering.
- Added some functions optimized for 64bit architectures.
- Added duff's device for 8 bit color keying.

Image Loading
- Premultiply image data when loading into premultiplied alpha surfaces.
- Limit number of weights to 64 in x and y direction for down scaling. Without this
  limitation down scaling to 1x1 or similar could take minutes on embedded platforms.
- If JFIF or Exif header detection failed, try detecting by filename extension.
- For PNGs with alpha don't always suggest DSPF_ARGB, but the primary layer format if it has alpha.

Font Loading
- If the font format is ARGB, use premultiplied font surfaces.
- Use "signed char" explicitly to fix kerning in FT2 loader on PPC, thanks to Uli <Uli.H@triple-dragon.org>!

- Enable X86 memcpy()s on AMD64.
- Added a generic memcpy() for 64bit Architectures.
- MMX and SSE support on AMD64.
- Fixed a bug in direct_list_remove()! If the last item is removed while other items exist,
  the first item's "prev" pointer was not updated (pointing to the last element).
- Added low level logging abstraction. Added runtime options "log-file = <name>"
  and "log-udp = <host>:<port>" for configuring the default log. 
- Added direct_thread_set_name() for setting the name of threads that haven't been created by direct_thread_create().
- Added DirectStream, a wrapper for accessing files locally and through network (http, ftp and generic tcp).

libfusion
- Added fusion_object_get() that gets a pool and an object id and returns
  the appropriate object with a local reference added to it. If the object
  is not found DFB_IDNOTFOUND is returned, or any abnormal other error from
  locking or referencing.
- Added FusionObjectID to replace plain int usage.
- Fixed an evil dead lock that only occured by moving a window with one of my new mice,
  having superior precision generating lots of events, thanks for spotting this bug, Logitech :)

  used for colorizing, simply modulate the color values with the alpha,
  otherwise overwrite them.

nVidia
- Rewrite of the driver, following the structure of other drivers, e.g. Matrox.
- Overlay and blitting supports Deinterlacing.
- WaitForSync no longer burns the CPU (but actually requires a 2.6 kernel).

0.9.22
------

API
- Added DLCAPS_ALPHA_RAMP: Alpha values for formats with one or two alpha
  bits can be chosen, i.e. using ARGB1555 or ARGB2554 the user can define
  the meaning of the two or four possibilities. In short, this feature
  provides a lookup table for the alpha of these formats.

  can display surfaces with premultiplied alpha.
- Added DSCAPS_PREMULTIPLIED indicating that the surface has
  premultiplied alpha data.

  to specify any combination of the flags: DSCAPS_INTERLACED, DSCAPS_SEPARATED
  or DSCAPS_PREMULTIPLIED.
- Added DLCAPS_SCREEN_POSITION and DLCAPS_SCREEN_SIZE.
  These are set if DLCAPS_SCREEN_LOCATION is set and vice versa.

- Added DSECONF_ADJUSTMENT to DFBScreenEncoderConfigFlags.
- Added 'DFBColorAdjustment adjustment' to DFBScreenEncoderConfig.

API | IDirectFB
- Cleaned up the way CreateSurface() determines the primary surface
  pixelformat and size. Previously the behavior varied depending on
  cooperative level and the force-desktop option. New behavior:
  1. DSDESC_{WIDTH,HEIGTH,PIXELFORMAT}
  2. SetVideoMode()
  3. mode= and pixelformat= options
  4. current layer config

API | IDirectFBDisplayLayer
- Added IDirectFBDisplayLayer::SetScreenPosition() which
  sets the position of the layer on the screen specified in pixels.
- Added IDirectFBDisplayLayer::SetScreenRectangle() which
  sets the position and size of the layer on the screen specified in pixels.

API | IDirectFBSurface
- Added IDirectFBSurface::SetAlphaRamp(a0,a1,a2,a3): Either all four values
  or the first and the last one are used, depending on the format.
  Default values are: 0x00, 0x55, 0xaa, 0xff.
- Added IDirectFBSurface::FillRectangles().

Build Options
- Added option "--with-inputdrivers=..." for selecting drivers to build,
  thanks to Marcel Siegert <mws@twisted-brains.org>!

Runtime Options

- Fixed YUV422 handling on big-endian architectures.
- Optimized Bop_yuy2_Sto_Aop() and Bop_uyvy_Sto_Aop(),
  these are used for StretchBlit() using YUY2 or UYVY.

Display Layer Core
- Keep a list of all realized (added) regions to remove them during
  emergency shutdown, e.g. signal received or missing deinit of master app.
- Added CLRCF_SURFACE_CAPS and field 'surface_caps' to CoreLayerRegionConfig
  in the display layer driver API.
- HW Windows created with DWDESC_SURFACE_CAPS and DSCAPS_PREMULTIPLIED
  in 'desc.surface_caps' are created as premultiplied layer regions.
- Store normalized and pixel based destination area in a layer context.
- Added CoreLayerLayoutMode which defines incorporation of
  configuration based size changes and destination area values.
- Activate the most recent context instead of the primary (shared) context
  when the current context is removed.
- Restore color adjustment when (re)activating a context.

Windowing Core
- Create layer regions for hw windows in single buffered mode, unless
  explicitly configured using DSCAPS_DOUBLE/TRIPLE or DWCAPS_DOUBLEBUFFER.
  This is a preliminary solution, because by default a window surface should
  require a Flip() to make changes visible.
- Activate DWOP_ALPHACHANNEL for other non indexed alpha formats, too.
- Implemented hw window resizing.

libfusion
- Take the largest one, if multiple tmpfs are found.

Proxy Interface Implementations (Voodoo)
- Implemented BatchBlit() in IDirectFBSurface_Requester and _Dispatcher.

Fixes (excerpt)
- Fixed a video memory leak in dfb_surface_reconfig() that happened if a  
  surface with multiple buffers is configured to have less, e.g. switching
  a layer from DLBM_TRIPLE/BACKVIDEO to DLBM_FRONTONLY.

dfblayer
- Show the layer level if supported.

Intel
- Added i830 driver (overlay support only) for Servision Ltd.
  (http://www.servision.net/)

  fb driver to be the one that it's expected to be.

nVidia
- Experimental alpha blending support for Riva TNT.
- Fixed NV20 and GeForce3 Xbox support, Blit() should work on the latter now.
- Added experimental support for NV30 chipsets.
- Found the way to make NVScaledImageFromMemory (used for StretchBlit,
  Alphablend, Color Conversion) work on NV20 chipset: it was another rivafb
  bug, therefore the rivafb-nv20fix-* patch is absolutely required.
- Added basic support for drawing with alphablend on NV20.
- Great performance improvements: it's possible to move a translucent window
  at 32bpp while the cpu stays idle.
- No longer return a surface stored in system memory for YUY2 and UYVY;
  return directly the video surface instead.
- Added FillRectangle() and Blit() (without effects) for YUY2 and UYVY.

  thanks to Marcel Siegert <mws@twisted-brains.org>!

Unique WM Module
- Lots of changes that have been lying around for more than two months,
  but this module is still not fully usable, yet.


0.9.21
------

API
- Added DFBLocation which is like DFBRectangle but has normalized coordinates.
- Added macros to compare rectangles, regions, locations, colors etc.
- Added diagonal cursor keys.
- Added more types to the auto generated "directfb_strings.h".
- Added DFBVertex containing transformed x, y, z, w, s and t coordinates.
- Added DSCAPS_DOUBLE and changed DSCAPS_FLIPPING to be a
  combination of DSCAPS_DOUBLE and DSCAPS_TRIPLE.

- Added DFXL_DRAWSTRING for IDirectFBSurface::GetAccelerationMask().
- Added prefix "ret_" to all output parameters.
- Added DFBSpan containing x and width of a span.
- When specified use the pixelformat of the surface description
  to create a windowed primary surface.
- Added DFB_VERSIONMISMATCH and DFB_NOSHAREDMEMORY error codes.
- Added DFBInsets specifying a distance from each
  edge of a rectangle: left, top, right, bottom.
- Added DLCAPS_SOURCES which indicates that the layer supports multiple 
  sources that can be selected, e.g. from frame buffer (surface) or from
  hardware decoders (using buffers outside of the frame buffer).
- Added DFBDisplayLayerSourceID with pre-defined DLSID_SURFACE.
- Added number of supported sources to DFBDisplayLayerDescription.
- Added DFBDisplayLayerSourceDescription containing the ID and a name.
- Added DLCONF_SOURCE along with a field in DFBDisplayLayerConfig to
  select the source to be used.

API | IDirectFB
- Added IDirectFB::EnumScreens() and IDirectFB::GetScreen().

API | IDirectFBEventBuffer

API | IDirectFBScreen
- New interface IDirectFBScreen for mixer, encoder and output settings.
- An output is connected to an encoder which is connected to a mixer which
  combines selected display layers.
- Added a lot of types for description and configuration of these components.
  (see the API Reference Manual for more details)

API | IDirectFBSurface
- Added IDirectFBSurface::TextureTriangles() using a surface as the texture,
  a pointer to a DFBVertex array, an optional index array, the array size and
  the DFBTriangleFormation which can be DTTF_LIST, DTTF_STRIP or DTTF_FAN.
- Added IDirectFBSurface::BatchBlit() which increases pixel throughput  
  of many small blits with same source and destination, e.g. custom font
  rendering like GTK+-DirectFB does.
- Preliminary depth buffer support using DSCAPS_DEPTH to allocate and use it,
  currently hard coded to 16 bit, only useful for TextureTriangles().
- Added DSFLIP_PIPELINE for advanced synchronization with the accelerator,
  currently implemented for Flip() on window surfaces. This feature is for
  accelerators with a command buffer that can store more graphics operations
  than required to render one frame.
- Added IDirectFBSurface::FillSpans() which is passed a DFBSpan array.

Runtime Options
- Added "force-desktop" to run fullscreen applications in the background.
- Added "a1-font" to force usage of monochrome fonts (FreeType2).
- Added "linux-input-ir-only" which tells the linux input driver
  to ignore all non-IR Linux Input devices.
- Added "wm=<wm>" to select the window manager module to use.
- Added "[no-]trace".
- Users can enable/disable debug output separately,
  e.g. using "no-debug,debug=direct,no-debug=direct/memcpy".
- Added "vt-switching" which is enabled by default.
- Added "no-vt" which disables usage of VT code completely.
- Added "no-decorations" to disable automatic window decorations
  of the "UniQuE" window manager implementation.

- Added "--enable-zlib" that activates gzipped screen shots etc.
- Added "--enable-voodoo", default is no.
- V4L2 has to be enabled explicitly via "--enable-video4linux2".
- Detect cygwin, default to static builds and don't require libdl.
- In static build mode, add an ".o" version of the ".a" module file.
  Applications can link statically against the ".o" files without having
  to specify an extra linker option for each module, e.g. "-Wl,-udirectfb_sdl".
- Applied patch from "Oskar Liljeblad <oskar@osk.mine.nu>"   
  which adds the configure option "--disable-sonypi-jogdial".
- Added "--disable-wm97xx" to disable WM97xx driver.
- With "--disable-gettid" one can enforce usage of getpid(),
  e.g. on broken systems where gettid() simply segfaults,
  though the system call is present in <linux/unistd.h>.
- Added "--enable-unique", disabled by default.

Pixel Formats
- Added DSPF_AiRGB, i.e. DSPF_ARGB with inverted alpha channel.
- Added DSPF_A1, e.g. for monochrome fonts.
- Removed DSPF_RGB15 in the flavor of DSPF_ARGB1555.
- Added DFB_COLOR_BITS_PER_PIXEL(format), DFB_ALPHA_BITS_PER_PIXEL(format)
  and DFB_PIXELFORMAT_INV_ALPHA(format).
- Added DFB_PIXELFORMAT_ALIGNMENT(format) which is non-zero if alignment
  is required to do byte aligned access, e.g. 7 for DSPF_A1.
- Added DSPF_NV12 (planar YUV).
  (8 bit Y plane followed by one 16 bit quarter size CbCr [15:0] plane)
- Added DSPF_NV16 (planar YUV).
  (8 bit Y plane followed by one 16 bit half width CbCr [15:0] plane)

System
- Use gettid() instead of getpid() if available.

Graphics Core
- Minimize state changes during text drawing.
- Drivers can choose between byte/pixel pitch alignment, or even use both.
- Added convenience macros and inline functions for setting state members.
- Added CoreGraphicsSerial storing the "serial" of a certain graphics operation.
- Added GetSerial() and WaitSerial() to the graphics driver API:
  GetSerial() returns the serial of the last queued graphics operation.
  WaitSerial() waits until the operation with the specified serial is finished.
- Store the serial of the most recent accelerated graphics operation that has
  been queued for writing to a surface buffer.
- dfb_layer_region_flip_update() is no longer waiting for an idle accelerator, 
  if the buffer that is becoming the front has or had a write operation queued.
  Instead it waits exactly for the last operation that is or was about to write
  to this buffer. If WaitSerial() is not supported by the driver and/or hardware,
  the fallback, of course, is to wait for each and every operation to finish.
- Wait for only the last write operation queued for a buffer,
  if the software needs to access it.
- Speed up tiled blitting by clipping in advance.
- Implemented software clipping for hardware accelerated DrawRectangle().
- Use hardware accelerated FillRectangle() if DrawRectangle() is not accelerated.
- Removed the surface listeners attached by dfb_state_set_destination() and  
  dfb_state_set_source().
- Added dfb_state_update() which does the work of the removed listeners
  if direct_serial_update() returns true. Updating the source is optional.
  Only surfaces set via dfb_state_set_*() are handled.
- Use dfb_state_update() in dfb_gfxcard_state_acquire() and gAcquire().
- Added parameter "write_front" to dfb_surface_flip_buffers() which is useful  
  for triple buffering. If true, the new back buffer will be the front buffer. 
  Drivers should detect if the current front buffer is not being shown already,
  in which case the idle buffer might be still shown and should not be written.
- Added "__u32 dfb_color_to_aycbcr( const DFBColor *color )".

Display Layer Core
- Refactored display layer core.
- Added contexts along with regions allocated within them.
- Drivers are only aware of regions. Usually a driver supports one region
  per layer. Hardware windows are implemented via hardware regions.

Input Core
- Added dfb_input_add_global() and dfb_input_set_global() to register global 
  reactions at run time, e.g. from another library or module in which case the   
  static reaction table can't be initialized with the address of those functions.
- Cleaned up input core code, e.g. by replacing the "inlined" singly linked list
  code by using a "DirectLink" and the "direct_list_*()" functions, or by adding
  usage of D_MAGIC_ASSERT() etc.

Windowing Core
- Pressing <Meta>-<Ctrl> + Left/Right Click generates 3rd/4th button event.
- Switch to color keyed cursor if shape doesn't have alpha or if translucent
  windows are disabled.
- Changed <Meta>-'S' to raise the lowest window, e.g. to revert a <Meta>-'A'.
- Added <Meta>-<Escape> to switch from fullscreen mode to the desktop.
  (currently not advisable if a flipping fullscreen app is still rendering)
- Modularized window management for different implementations on desktop
  and embedded systems.
- Added new experimental window manager "UniQuE" with window decorations.
- Added a CoreWindowConfig containing position, size, opacity, stacking,
  options, events, color key and opaque region.

Software Driver
- Added DSBLIT_DEINTERLACE support to gBlit.
- Implemented missing blending modes.
- Implemented lots of missing format specific code.
- Implemented stretchblitting for YUV.
- Fix a8 font rendering for argb1555, i.e. remove alpha pits around glyphs.
- Replaced gDrawLine() by gFillRectangle() in rectangle outline drawing code.
- Allocate accumulators dynamically.
- Lots of optimizations and fixes.

Debugging Support
- Major speed up by using thread specific data instead of gettid().
- Use popen("nm -n ...") to load symbols of any module on demand.
- Show static symbols in stack traces.
- Produce gdb like stack dumps (output formatting).
- Added thread names to debug output, stack traces etc.
- Added interface instance tracking in debug mode, showing remaining
  instances at exit time (like it's done for allocated memory).
- Added debug domains which can be enabled/disabled separately.
- Added "<Meta>-<BackSpace>" debugging shortcut for
  dumping the stack of each thread of the master process.
- Align debug output of domains.
- Indent debug output if trace support is enabled
  by using direct_trace_debug_indent() which sets the flag TF_DEBUG for the
  current frame and returns the current debug message indention level by
  examining the stack, counting any upper frames that produced debug output.
- Added tons of assertions and assumption, mostly to new code.
- Added support for A8,YUY2 and UYVY surfaces in dfb_surface_dump().

Fixes (excerpt)
- No need to call SetOpacity() before RequestFocus() for input only windows.
- Don't allow GetWindow() on the cursor window.
- Don't wait for Fusion Dispatch Thread during emergency shutdown.
- Fixed missing MMX initialization in slaves, only the master used MMX before.
- Use RTLD_NOW to detect undefined symbols before the module is used at all.

libdirect
- Migrated base functionality (threads, signals, interfaces, debugging,
  lists, modules etc.) into a separate library that can even be used by apps.
- Added direct_clock_set_start() that is called by Fusion's initialization
  to synchronize time stamps of debug messages.

  DFB_NOSYSTEMMEMORY if used as a (return) value.
- Added D_OOSHM() which is the same as D_OOM() in single app build.
  Only in multi app build it prints the warning "out of shared memory"
  and gives DFB_NOSHAREDMEMORY if used as a (return) value.

- Added some assertions and assumptions to the shared memory code.
- Added a parameter to fusion_skirmish_init() and fusion_reactor_init() to  
  set the name of the skirmish or reactor using the ioctl FUSION_ENTRY_SET_INFO.

  skirmish for all reactors which is created during Fusion's initialization.
- Added fusion_reactor_set_lock() to use another skirmish for the global
  reactions of the reactor.
- Added fusion_object_set_lock() to set the skirmish for the global reactions
  of the object's reactor, while default is the skirmish used to lock the pool.

  has no surface, but the hardware is aware of each window and displays
  the window stack. Added DLCAPS_WINDOWS, too.
- Added <Meta>-<Print> hot key to make a screenshot of the focused window
  including its alpha channel if present. Creates a ppm (RGB) and a pgm (alpha).

- Added support for 'gsync true', 'csync high' and 'extsync true' in fb.modes.
- Added 8bit RGB332 pixelformat, implementation is not complete yet.
  If you want RGB332, you have to enable it using ./configure --enable-rgb332.
- Optimized RGB15/RGB16 color keyed blit (doubled performance on some CPUs).
- Allow RGB15 mode on fbdev drivers that report to use one bit for alpha.
- Fixed blocking of CreateImageProvider when called on /dev/video with BTTV.
- DirectFB now restores the palette during deinitialization, turns cursor and
  blanking back on and restores the terminal attributes like local echo.
  These fixes help a lot when using DirectFB with the option "--no-vt-switch".
- Updated NeoMagic frame buffer driver patch for 2.4.10 and above.
- Updated aty128fb frame buffer driver patch. The patch was tested with kernel
  versions from 2.4.7 - 2.4.12. It may work with older versions too.
- IDirectFBSurface::SetSrcColorKey has to be called on the source now,
  when blitting to a surface which has source color keying enabled.
- SetSrcColorKey and SetDstColorKey take three values now: r, g and b.
  They will be converted to the pixelformat of the surface automatically.
- Some minor fixes.

0.9.6
-----

- Added H3600 (ipaq) Touchscreen input driver.

- YUY2 format added for video playback.
- Added 'IDirectFBDisplayLayer::Set/GetColorAdjustment()'.
- Added simple layer example which plays a video onto the second layer.
- Added new window capability DWCAPS_DOUBLEBUFFER to create windows with
  two back buffers. This is useful for overlapping windows which both
  cause frequent updates of the window stack.
- Added 'IDirectFBWindow::Close()' that puts a 'DWET_CLOSE' event into the
  window's event queue. The event dispatcher thread can then decide to close it.
- Added 'IDirectFBWindow::Destroy()' which actually destroys the window after
  sending a 'DWET_DESTROYED' event, so the event dispatcher thread can notice
  and release any interfaces belonging to it.
- Added result 'DFB_DESTROYED' which is currently returned by 'IDirectFBWindow'
  and 'IDirectFBSurface' if the window or surface has been destroyed.
- Fixed surface manager bug causing inconsistency between video/system memory.
- More changes to surface manager fixing problems when using many many threads.
- Fixed segfault when loading big PNGs, seemed to be a problem with alloca.

  about alpha channel availability and possible color keys.
- New LIRC input driver, name your keys (lirc config file) like the DirectFB
  keycode enum does without the "DIKC_" prefix, e.g. "OK", "MENU" or "VOLUMEUP".
- First version of nVidia RIVA TNT/TNT2/GeForce driver (very limited right now).
- Updated kernel patches, improved synchronization for FBIO_WAITFORVSYNC.
- New pkg-config file "directfb-internal.pc" for better support
  for third party modules built outside the DirectFB source tree.
- You can move windows with the mouse when holding down CapsLock.
- Font width can now be set independent from height, e.g. for non-square pixels.
- Set gamma ramp, fixes "strange-colors-effect" with some frame buffer drivers.
- Accept interlaced or double scan modes, 320x200 looks really cool in some way.
- Deinitialization code cleaned up and reactivated.
- V4L capturing is now stopped by exit and signal handlers.
- Matrox driver cleanup and blending state fixes.
- More detailed generated API Reference (more comments in directfb.h).
- Many bug fixes, some compile fixes.

0.9.4
------

- Software driver pipeline optimization giving me 70% speed up for solid lines.
- Several bugfixes for image loading, Matrox driver, mode handling and more.
- Removed 'realloc()s' that caused callback functions to write into the
  old memory location if 'realloc()' returns a new one.

  the provider, 'Set/GetColorAdjustment()' set/get values like contrast etc.
- Cursor can be enabled/disabled and opacity can be set independently.
  Also cursor appears centered now.
- Experimental support for VT switching during runtime ;-)
- New command line option "--force-windowed" which already works with most of
  the examples, levels other than DFSCL_NORMAL give DFB_ACCESSDENIED.
- GIF loading to ARGB fixed, transparent GIFs are now supported as ARGB.
- Several fixes to video mode list and pixelformat handling in
  'read_modes()', 'fbdev_set_mode()' and 'fbdev_get_pixelformat()'.
- Added IDirectFBSurface->DrawLines(), used by df_dok now.
- Some optimizations in DrawString and core font handling.
- Fixed font problems with Matrox cards, their texture cache is flushed
  now after writing the glyph into the frame buffer (i.e. into the texture).
- Mouse cursor movements are now clipped by the screen ;-)

- API change for DFBSurfaceDescription (pixelformat field instead of bpp
  field, removed DSCAPS_ALPHA.)
- DrawString() and GetStringWidth() support UTF-8 encoded strings now. They
  take an additional parameter that specifies the number of bytes to use from 
  the passed string or -1 for the complete string.
- Fonts are no longer loaded completely, instead glyphs are loaded on demand
  and are cached for later use.
- Font kerning tables are no longer loaded by the core.
- Removed default font from the core and made it a IDirectFBFont interface.
  Pass NULL as filename to CreateFont() to get the default font.
- Added MPEG video provider written by Kim JeongHoe based on libmpeg3.
- Performance improvements in the software functions for DrawLine(), 16 bit
  drawing functions and DrawString() in all depth.

0.9.1
------

- pkg-config files are available for optionally installed interfaces
  like IDirectFBVideoProvider_AviFile, so apps can test for their existence.
- Added IDirectFBInputDevice->GetButtonState() which returns the
  state of the specified button. GetButtons() is also still available.
- New demo called "df_knuckles" draws a three dimensional lighted skull
  that can be rotated by the mouse. (Port from Mark Vojkovich's DGA demo)
- Fixed accelerator ids in neomagic driver to match the ids in the
  current neofb kernel patch that is now included in "patches".
- Moved command-line parsing out of DirectFBCreate() into DirectFBInit().
  This means to inititalize DirectFB() there are now two calls necessary:
  DirectFBInit( &argc, &argv ); DirectFBCreate( &dfb );
- Added IDirectFBSurface->FillTriangle() for solid and blended triangles.
  Implemented in generic driver and Voodoo, Matrox acceleration.
- Interfaces with a reference counter of zero are automatically freed
  unless you enabled debugging during configure. In debug mode a released
  interface returns DFB_DEAD if a function has been called.
- Added Shockwave Flash Video Provider written by Joachim 'Roh' Steiger.
  You will need the libflash, that can be downloaded as a shared library
  from our download section. No modifications of libflash code.

  but "/dev/video0" and so on. Removed v4l code from core.
- AviFile Provider updated to compile with newest AviFile version.
- Implemented flipping of surfaces that are no window or layer surfaces,
  when the surface is a subsurface, a flipping region has been specified
  or the flipping flag DSFLIP_BLIT has been used.
