1.0.0-rc4
---------

FBDev System Module
- Many thanks to Vaclav Slavik for fixing up VT initialization.
  Check the ChangeLog for a detailed description.

Unichrome Driver
- Allow for improved timing of video layer flips when the FIELD_PARITY option
  is in use.  The improvement is only possible if the kernel framebuffer
  supports it.  If not, we do the best we can but occasional glitches may
  occur under high processor load.

Misc/minor (usually not in a summary, but due to the few changes...)
- Distribute autogen.sh
- Add new lines to work around nested structs being taken by the doc generator.
- Avoid cutting away the last pixel of a planar yuv row.


1.0.0-rc3
---------

API
- Added IDirectFBWindow::SetBounds() to do a move and resize in one step.
- New window option DWOP_SCALE prevents the surface from being resized when the window
  size on screen changes, i.e. via IDirectFBWindow::Resize() or SetBounds().
- The surface can be resized separately using IDirectFBWindow::ResizeSurface() if needed.
- Enable DWOP_SCALE by default for windowed primary surface (IDirectFB::CreateSurface).
- Fixed DIKT_UNICODE detection in DFB_KEY_TYPE(symbol) for values > 255.

Runtime Options
- New runtime option "scaled=<width>x<height>" scales the window to the specified size
  for 'force-windowed' apps. The surface size will not be affected, still set via "mode=".
- Added options "debugmem" and "debugshm" to turn on local/shared memory allocation
  debugging separately from "debug" option.
- Let "debugmem" option only influence output of allocations, but always track
  them in debug enabled builds.
- Added option "no-software" to disable software fallbacks. This is mainly for
  debugging/profiling purpose. It will print out a warning with the operation
  and flags each time a fallback would occur.
- Read DIRECTFB_SESSION variable after reading all files and DFBARGS,
  so only the command line can override the current session.
- Added runtime option "force-slave" to always enter as a slave, waiting for
  the master, if not already there. This feature only works with recent kernel module.

Graphics Core
- Added InvalidateState() at driver level API to notify the driver that
  the current rendering state is no longer valid.

Surface Core
- Added ability to let only one Fusionee write to a surface,
  set via owner field of CoreSurface.
- Don't try to immediately allocate the new video instance when reallocating
  a buffer (unless the policy is CSP_VIDEOONLY). Fixes corruption problems
  in XDirectFB caused by window resize failing.
- Dispatch surface's notifications directly (if local).
  This change fixes an assertion failure that happens in the following case:
  Resize (Downsize) Surface ... and immediatly after ... Blit to Surface.

Layer Core
- Support DLBM_BACKSYSTEM as a (driver) default.

Window Core
- Give the WM a chance to provide its own surface.
  The WM may link a surface to the window in the PreConfigureWindow() call.
- Dispatch window's notifications directly (if local).

Software Rendering
- Added Bop_argb_blend_alphachannel_src_invsrc_Aop_PFI[] as a fast path for blending
  from ARGB with SRCALPHA / INVSRCALPHA. Implemented for RGB16 and RGB32 so far.
- Use cpp templates for 16bpp and 32bpp code.
- Removes duplicated code.
- Implements some missing gfx funcs.
- Fixes missing EXPAND() calls in some acc funcs.
- Fixes blit direction handling in some 16bpp blit funcs.

Utils
- Added some basic update region management (DFBUpdates) with functions for adding
  updates, keeping a maximum number of regions, merging if possible or required.
  First version, IQ 10.

libdirect
- Autodetect clock skew.
- Added direct_list_move_to_front( **list, *link ).
- Added direct_snputs(s,d,n) to set a string with a maximum size including the
  zero termination. This acts like a strncpy(d,s,n), but always terminates the
  string like snprintf(d,n,"%s",s) which is more or less slower.
- If trace support and shared libraries are enabled, for each library to install,
  also generate a file containing the output of "nm -n <that library>".
  That's the command that is used at runtime via popen().
- Now the code first checks if it can fopen() a file with the same name as the one passed
  to "nm -n", but with an "nm-n." prefix. This is both a performance improvement and a nice
  solution for (embedded) targets without 'nm' being available or fast enough.

libdirect (optional part)
- Implemented seekability over RTSP.

libfusion
- Use MADV_REMOVE if possible to give memory back to the system after freeing a block
  in the middle of the heap.
- No more signal handler used, because no more mremap() is done, only ftruncate()
  is called to resize the shared memory heap. The initial mmap() now covers the whole
  address range.
- Initialize the heap info table to serve for the maximum pool size specified
  at creation of the pool. Previously, the initial table served for 4 MB heap.
  If there were more allocations, the heap info table was reallocated at the
  end of the heap, i.e. at 4 MB making it impossible to ever go back below
  the 4 MB heap size. Next barrier was 8 MB, 16 MB ...these are gone.
- The maximum size specified during creation of a pool is now taken as an
  additional size after the heap info table. Previously, it could happen that
  the size was too small to host the fixed sized heap info table.
- Include Fusion ID of allocator and offset within heap in shm allocation debug info.
- Print shared memory leaks on pool shutdown (debug mode and 'debugshm' option).
- Added fusion_reactor_direct(bool) to specify whether local message handlers (reactions)
  should be called directly, which has been the previous behaviour for years...
- Fall back to /dev/shm if no mount point could be determined.
- Added FCEF_NODIRECT which forces execution of the call in the Fusion
  Dispatch thread even if it's the calling process' own call.
- Only call fusion_sync() if the pool that is to be destroyed has objects.
- Fixed fusion_sync() timeout during XDirectFB shutdown.
- Fixed concurrent startup of master and slaves.

Voodoo
- Missing methods added and more implemented.

PNG Image Provider
- Support loading of indexed PNG files directly to LUT8 surface.
- Provide palette of image via GetSurfaceDescription().

FT2 Font
- Added support for LUT2 fonts for using fast antialiased text rendering with indexed to indexed translation.
- Thanks to Vaclav Slavik for fixing loading of mono-only fonts.

Default WM
- Added support for scaled windows.
- Make cursor area backing store surface same format as layer.
- Use DFBUpdates to manage an update queue and do optimizations like taking
  the bounding box instead of multiple smaller regions if the number of pixels
  in the bounding box is not much higher than the total of the smaller ones.
- Even this takes the number of smaller regions into account, because of the
  increasing overhead per region.
- Next to performance, the visual experience is enhanced by coalesced updates.
- Another advantage is that when multiple regions are updated, first it renders
  all regions and then it flips all regions. Previously, each time the flip was
  done immediately for each rendered region.

Radeon Driver
- Implemented StretchBlit, TextureTriangles, Alphablend, Deinterlacing
  for the R300 chipset family, thanks to Timon +timon37 * interia-pl+!!!
- Support color keying for TMU based functions on R300.

Unichrome Driver
- Implemented acceleration for blits involving the AiRGB pixel format.
- DSPF_AiRGB is now supported as a source format for most blits and stretch blits.
- Blits _to_ AiRGB surfaces are also accelerated provided they don't require blending.

Linux Input
- Added Touchpad support!

tslib Input
- New driver, thanks to Shane Volpe!

dfbdump tool
- Added the option "-p" to pause() dfbdump after initialization, e.g.
  to run it as a master and look at the foot print or other things that
  are there before any application specific stuff happens.
- Show allocations in both DirectFB shared memory pools with option "-s".


1.0.0-rc2
---------

API
- Breaking API Freeze but keeping source and binary compatibility!
- All __u8, __s16 etc. types have been changed to u8, s16 etc.
- Compatibility is in place unless DIRECTFB_NO_CRUFT is defined.
- Added DSPF_LUT2 being indexed 2 bit per pixel packed, i.e. four pixel in one byte.

API | IDirectFBSurface
- Added SetIndexTranslation() that sets a translation table used for
  fast indexed to indexed pixel format conversion. Negative or undefined values in the
  table will result in no pixel being written.
- Added DSBLIT_INDEX_TRANSLATION to do fast indexed to indexed translation, this flag
  is mutual exclusive with all others.
- So far only LUT2 to LUT8 is supported, used for fast anti-aliased text rendering
  to indexed format. The translation table contains "-1, 36, 37, 38" for example.
  First entry makes the background transparent and the other three are shaded versions
  of the text color.

Build Options
- Use libpng-config if present. Thanks to Gery <gxkahn-et-gmail.com>!

Runtime Options
- Added "primary-only" to tell applications only about the primary layer, pretending there are no others.
- Fixed "tmpfs" option.
- Fixed "pixelformat" option.
- Don't depend on "debug" option when printing interface leakage at exit time (only debug builds).

Core
- No longer create a new process group in dfb_core_create().
- Don't take certain locks in core shutdown functions if emergency is true.

Layer Core
- In dfb_layer_context_get_primary_region() if increasing the ref count of the
  existing primary region fails, due it being destroyed, wait for a short time
  and try again, probably recreating the region.

Surface Core
- Fixed bug in auto-video surface locking that could return a NULL pointer.

libfusion
- Safely cycle through hash nodes while freeing them.
- Don't print an error if an object revived after it's ref count reached
  zero but got increased again before the destructor is called. That applies
  to the multi application core only. In the single application core the
  destructor is called synchronously.

libdirect
- Use readdir_r() instead of readdir().
- Don't include config.h in direct/types.h. Fix stdbool.h warnings.
- No longer use pthread_kill(KILL) which doesn't only kill the specified thread, use pthread_cancel().
- Let direct_assert() and others try raise(TRAP) first, then killpg(0,TRAP) and pthread_exit().
- At the end of the global signal handler no longer use killpg(0,KILL) but remove all handlers,
  raise(num), abort() and then exit( -num ). But the exit shouldn't be reached.
- Register signal handler with empty instead of full blocking mask and use SA_NODEFER except
  for SIGSEGV. Also no longer use SA_RESTART.
- Use recursive mutexes in trace support if available.

libdirect (optional network stuff)
- Replaced the usage of setitimer()+recv() in net_peek() with a single call to select().
- Fixed username/password parsing.

DGIFF
- DirectFB Glyph Image File Format
- Purpose of DGIFF is to offload as much as possible from runtime, especially during
  application startup when loading the default or system fonts.
- Added a new font module and a tool called mkdgiff to generate .dgiff from .ttf or other.
- mkdgiff uses FreeType2 to load the glyphs of the font and stores them in one or more ready
  to use font cache rows, up to 2047 pixels wide right now.
- The loader creates preallocated surfaces from the mmapped font file. The only copy ever
  made would be when the surface is transfered to video memory for acceleration.
- DGIFF supports different sizes of one face in a single file.

DFIFF
- Build mkdfiff only if PNG support is enabled.

FT2 Font
- Made DFFA_NOCHARMAP work again.
- If Unicode/Latin1 failed, try Symbol Encoding and do some 0xf000 magic.

Mach64
- Disable dithering when doing alpha blended blits. Dithering it is applied
  even when the source pixels are completely transparent. This change makes
  the mouse cursor look sane.

Matrox
- Include <linux/i2c.h> and <linux/i2c-dev.h> now.

SiS315
- Include <linux/sisfb.h> now.
- Build only if this header is found by configure.

Linux Input
- Ignore repeat events for mouse buttons.

FBDev System
- Use other signals than SIGUSR1/SIGUSR2 for vt-switching.

Other fixes
- Plugged mem leak of AttachedWindow struct when DetachEventBuffer() happens
  after the window has been destroyed.
- Fix Bop_a8_set_alphapixel_Aop_yuy2() for big endian.
- Remove/relicense GPL code.


1.0.0-rc1
---------

API
- Added DIEF_FOLLOW to DFBInputEventFlags which indicates that another event
  will follow immediately. In the mouse driver this is used to "link" the x/y
  axis motion events. The window manager no longer sends two motion events (x/0, 0/y)
  for one x/y mouse movement (x and y axis at once). Zig-zag cursor/window movement
  and double event/update rate are gone.
- Moved DirectFBGL header to the proper location. We need the header here since the DirectFBGL
  interface is strongly integrated within DirectFB and we want to support external implementations.
- More Porter/Duff rules (SRC_ATOP,DST_ATOP,ADD,XOR).
- Added DFB_SUSPENDED error meaning "The requested object is suspended!".
- Added 4 bit packed alpha pixel format DSPF_A4, e.g. for fonts.
- Added support for the 18bpp format family.

API | IDirectFBDisplayLayer
- Added SwitchContext() that switches between the shared
  and the exclusive context if present.
- Added SetClipRegions() that, if supported by hardware, sets the clipping regions that are used to to
  enable or disable visibility of parts of the layer. The number of regions is stated in the display layer
  description. The layer will be shown only in these regions or except in these regions.

API | IDirectFBFont
- Added GetStringBreak() to break a text line by line. Thanks to sridewa <sridewa@gmail.com>.
- Added EnumEncodings() enumerating all provided encodings, also see Fonts section below.
- Added FindEncoding() to look up an encoding directly by its name.
- Added SetEncoding() for choosing the encoding for local interface methods and as a default for the surfaces.

API | IDirectFBImageProvider
- Added DIRenderCallbackResult to DIRenderCallback to be able to abort rendering.

API | IDirectFBInputDevice
- Added DetachEventBuffer() to detach an event buffer explicitly.

API | IDirectFBScreen
- Allow connectors to be selected at the encoders without the need to define
  outputs, add slow blanking, thanks to Daniel J Laird <danieljlaird@hotmail.com>.
- Populating screen API a bit more, thanks to Daniel Laird <danieljlaird@hotmail.com>.
- Added GetSize().

API | IDirectFBSurface
- Added ReleaseSource() to release a possibly attached source,
  e.g. after blitting from it only once and from nothing else afterwards.
- Added GetFramebufferOffset() returning the offset within
  the graphics memory, thanks to Stefan Lucke <stefan@lucke.in-berlin.de>.
- Added GetPosition() returning the offset of a sub surface.
- Finally decided to catch horizontal/vertical lines in DrawLine() and optimize them using rectangle filling.
- Added SetEncoding() to choose an encoding for the text routines, will be overwritten by SetFont() which takes
  the default encoding of the new font, also see Fonts section below.

API | IDirectFBVideoProvider
- Removed return value from DVFrameCallback.
- Added SetPlaybackFlags(), SetSpeed() and GetSpeed().
- Added SetVolume() and GetVolume().

API | IDirectFBWindow
- Added DetachEventBuffer() to detach an event buffer explicitly.

Build Options
- Added option --enable-netork to enable/disable building network protocols handlers.

Fonts
- Added support for other encodings than UTF8. Encodings are (or can be) provided
  with each font implementation. This model reduces code sharing slightly, but   
  allows higher efficiency via optimized combination of decoding and translation.
- Every encoding just has a name and an ID, where the name can be chosen freely,
  except for DTEID_UTF8 which is always available and has the name "UTF8".
- Implemented UTF8 and "Latin1" encoding in FT2 font loader. Nice demonstration how
  different encodings can be used, while still having a single glyph cache, which is
  no longer based on character codes, but on their raw indices.
- See ChangeLog from 2006-05-06 for more details.

Graphics Core
- Added DFBResult return value to graphics driver's EngineSync() and WaitSerial()
  to be able to return DFB_TIMEDOUT or other errors. In these cases the core resets
  the accelerator via EngineReset() and takes care of state invalidation etc.
- dfb_gfxcard_sync() and dfb_gfxcard_waitserial() also lease the graphics property,
  i.e. there are no more concurrent calls to the driver, e.g. FillRectangle() along
  with EngineSync().
- Moved clipping from dfb_clip_stretchblit() to gStretchBlit() doing all clipping,
  phase and offset calculations in place, otherwise clipping suffered from rounding
  and off-by-one errors due to going back to integer in between.
- In case of no hardware clipping but rectangle filling, if in DrawRectangle()
  the whole rectangle outline was outside the clipping area, the clipping area
  was drawn in the software fallback code.
- In dfb_surfacemanager_deallocate() make sure no hardware read or write
  access on the buffer is pending before freeing the chunk.
- Added global function pointer __DFB_CoreRegisterHook with __DFB_CoreRegisterHookCtx
  to allow application level layer (and screen) implementations building on top of existing layers.
- New capabilities for setting destination size limit. If the rectangle is
  too big, first try clip, then try again and eventually fall back to software.
- Implemented font cache limit, currently hardcoded to five rows, each row stores a number of glyphs.
  When the maximum number is reached it will reuse the least recently used row, kicking out all glyphs
  that have been on it.
- Before every graphics operation, i.e. in dfb_gfxcard_state_check(),
  clip the state's clipping region to the destination surface dimension.

Input Core
- First and fully working implementation of dead key handling using static
  tables for mapping of dead keys and following symbols to the combined symbol.

Surface Core
- Some changes that decrease system memory usage for surface buffers, especially where graphics memory
  is available.
- Allocate system instance of auto-video buffers on first access, not immediately during creation of the surface.
- Deallocate system memory when buffer is written to in video memory. Reallocate it if the buffer is kicked out
  of video memory.
- Implemented "suspended" surface buffers, temporarily deallocated. No valid instance at all until it's resumed.
- Added dfb_surface_buffer_suspend/resume().
- Added SBF_SUSPENDED.
- Align pitch of system memory buffers to be a multiple of 8 instead 4.
- Add extra 16 bytes at the end of a buffer as a dummy area for optimized
  routines, e.g. to avoid segfaults due to prefetching.

Window Core
- Rewritten cursor handling (software cursor) to use a surface instead of a window.
  The window manager module gets notified about all kinds of updates regarding the cursor.
  All window manager modules use the same code for now, using backing store for the region under
  the cursor. This avoids revealing window content that hasn't been commited via Flip(), yet.
  It should also be faster as it no longer depends on the windows that are covered by the cursor.
- Check if window is destroyed and return DFB_DESTROYED in all functions
  which would have called the WM, because a destroyed window is no longer
  known to the WM and the WM's window data structure is deallocated.

Software Renderer
- Fix unaligned 32 bit accesses in color keying code.
- Allocate the accumulator only if it will be used.
- Check if palettes are equal when blitting indexed formats.

Misc
- Added dfb_rectangle_subtract() to subtract insets from rectangle.
- Added DFB_RECTANGLE_CONTAINS_POINT and DFB_REGION_CONTAINS_POINT macros.
- Added dfb_gfx_copy_to() as an extension of dfb_gfx_copy(). The advantages are
  different x/y offset for source/destination and blitting from back buffer.
  The latter was a must for the backing store based software cursor.

libdirect
- Reworked Direct/Stream to gain more efficiency, added several optional network protocols.
- Added direct_stream_mime() that returns mime description of the stream.
- In addition to DIRECT_FORCE_DEBUG one can use DIRECT_ENABLE_DEBUG now.
- Only duplicate used portion of array in direct_trace_copy_buffer(), set limit from 256 to 200.
- Added BSWAP16 and BSWAP32 macros, direct_base64_encode, direct_base64_decode and direct_md5_sum.
- Due to increasing amount of debug messages the default is "no-debug" now. It makes more sense to
  only enable wanted debug domains by hand, e.g. "debug=core/font". Otherwise, "debug" option still
  works, too.
- Replaced direct_stream_fopen() by direct_stream_fileno().
- Added direct_stream_dup() to increase the stream's reference counter.
- In the stack trace show base address of each file to allow offset calculation 'by hand' within
  dynamically loaded modules, i.e. where ldd doesn't help.

libfusion
- Local 'local reactions' are no longer processed before dispatching further via the kernel device.
  This causes all local reactions within each Fusionee to be called by the Fusion Dispatcher only,
  in chronological order. It's a fundamental change in runtime behaviour which might break some code
  that relies on the synchronous execution of the dispatcher's own local reactions.
- Implemented experimental fork() handling in Fusion. Added FusionForkAction being FFA_CLOSE by default,
  which can be changed to FFA_FORK with a call to fusion_world_set_fork_action() for each Fusionee/World.
- Added "name" parameter to fusion_ref_init() like others already have.
- Return DFB_LOCKED in fusion_ref_up() if EAGAIN is received (ref is zero locked).
- New shared hash table implementation and property support for object.
- Added fusion_skirmish_lock_count() returning the lock counter if held by the caller.
- Added fusion_reactor_destroy() like fusion_reactor_free() but without freeing the shared structure etc.
- No longer (need to) access the shared structure during local message processing in the Fusion dispatcher.

i830 driver
- Fixed overlay destination color keying for 8/15/16 bit primary layer formats, add
  "i8xx_overlay_pipe_b" option, thanks to Stefan Lucke <stefan@lucke.in-berlin.de>.

Matrox driver
- Added field based blitting support.
- Added DSCAPS_SEPARATED support to BES, CRTC2 and SPIC.
- Fixed pixelpitch alignment for YUY2/UYVY.
- PAL-60 support (or at least close enough for Ville's TV).

nVidia driver
- Avoid to set the overlay memory limit, it's already done by the kernel.
- Basic acceleration for ALUT44.
- Disable host-to-video hardware blit for simple blits without format conversion.
- Added nvEngineReset().

Radeon driver
- R300: Support FillTriangle() and DSDRAW_BLEND.
- RV250: Dropped YUV->RGB support.
- Enable VC_32BIT_SWAP on big-endian machines.
- Removed (erroneously set) flag VF_RADEON_MODE in r200DoDrawRectangle3D().
- Added patch to radeonfb fixing support for R300 chipsets (it also adds new devices).
- Use different settings for R300 and non-R300 when setting MC_FB_LOCATION.
- Added the possibility to use the graphics layer as an OSD. It works exactly the same way
  as in the unichrome driver: Set the video layer level to -1 and enable DLOP_ALPHACHANNEL
  on the graphics layer.
- Applied patch by Christer Palm <christer.palm@pulsen.se>: fixes word swapping on PPC.

Unichrome driver
- Disable hardware cursor in VIA_REG_CURSOR_MODE. Thanks to Michel van
  Noorloos <michel.van.noorloos@sioux.nl>.
- Added PCI ID for CN700.

DynaPro input driver
- New 3M DynaPro Touchscreen driver, thanks to Pär Degerman <parde@ikp.liu.se>!

Keyboard input driver
- Added support for dead keys.

Linux Input input driver
- Added support for dead keys.

DFIFF image provider
- New DirectFB Fast Image File Format with a fast image provider module and a tool to
  convert images from PNG to DFIFF.

GIF image provider
- Dropped support for GIF87 (can't be animated).

GIF video provider
- New animated GIF video provider.

V4L video provider
- Fixed planar data copy.
- Added more pixelformats for v4l2.

FBDev System
- Clean up error handling in system_initialize() and fix bug with shared memory (de)allocation.
- Treat fbdev format 8/16,8/8,8/0,0/0 as ARGB when ARGB was requested
  (that because framebuffer drivers tend to ignore the alpha channel).
- Don't touch console blanking when using graphics-vt.

SDL System
- Better keymap emulation.
- Fake video modes by reading fb.modes, just like the fbdev backend.

directfb-csource tool
- Added option --rgbformat which in contrast to the --format option only is effective if the image
  doesn't require an alpha channel. That's useful e.g. with RGB16 for opaque and ARGB for blended images,
  when the primary format will be RGB16. So far directfb-csource either used ARGB/RGB32 automatically, or
  it always used RGB16 or whatever you specified via --format.
- Make structs and pixel data const, helps with use in shared libs.

fx tool
- Very basic program to emulate/illustrate the pixel pipeline, blitting flags etc. No 100% guarantee that
  itself is correct, but in the end it will serve as a verification for software/hardware driver.


0.9.25
------

API
- Added DSPF_AYUV, a 32bit packed AYUV format for graphics,
  being the counterpart of ARGB in the YUV color space.

API | IDirectFBSurface
- Added GetClip().

API | IDirectFBDisplayLayer
- Allow empty flags in SetColorAdjustment().
- Allow to control background and cursor in exclusive cooperative level.

API | IDirectFBEventBuffer
- Added DFBEventBufferStats containing various counters for the event queue,
  e.g. total number of events, number of window events, motion events etc.
  These reflect the current content of the queue, i.e. dequeueing decrements.
- Added EnableStatistics() to enable/disable collection.
- Added GetStatistics() to query current statistics.

API | IDirectFBVideoProvider
- Added SendEvent() to send a window or input event
  to video providers that supports interactivity (DVCAPS_INTERACTIVE).
  For cursor events, coordinates must be in the destination rectangle space.
- Added GetStreamDescription() to query informations about the stream.
- Added IDirectFBVideoProvider::GetStatus() to get the status of the playback;
  this method replaces the previous end-of-playback detection method using GetPos().

Runtime Options
- Added config option unichrome-revision=<rev> to manually set the hardware
  revision number for the unichrome driver.  This cannot be determined
  automatically unless the process runs as root.
- Added option [no-]dma (disabled by default).
- Added option fatal-level=<level>:
  Abort on NONE, ASSERT (default) or ASSUME (incl. assert)

Graphics Core
- Added FlushReadCache() to the graphics driver API.
  Used in the matrox driver to flush the direct access read cache.
- Pass CoreDFB to graphics drivers as a new argument to driver_init_driver().
- Added dfb_gfxcard_surface_{enter/leave}(), called when a software access to
  video memory begins/finishes.
- Fix negative line width handling in fill_tri().

Surface Core
- Added support for surfaces stored in auxiliray memory (PCI/AGP/PCIE).
- Added support for Surface Managers with a variable number of heaps.
- In dfb_surfacemanager_allocate() do dfb_gfxcard_sync() only if hardware has
  read from the buffer about to be kicked out. The call to
  dfb_surfacemanager_assure_system() should already take care of the hardware
  write case.
- Change dfb_surfacemanager_assure_system() to call dfb_gfxcard_wait_serial()
  instead of dfb_gfxcard_sync() since we're only interested whether the
  hardware has written to the buffer.
- Use a separate shared memory pool for surface buffer data.

Input Core
- Don't toggle lock states repeatedly when holding a lock key.
- Added FusionCall to each input device for maintenance via master,
  driver calls etc. using new CoreInputDeviceCommand enum.
- Added dfb_input_device_reload_keymap() implemented via the new call passing
  the CIDC_RELOAD_KEYMAP command. The master will reload the whole keymap via
  driver API.
- Added a new tool called "dfbinput" which features keymap dump/reload so far.
- DIKI_ALTGR is gone. The key right to the space bar is the right alt key.
  No matter which map is loaded, the identifiers are just named hardware keys,
  where you really specify the physical entity on your keyboard. In this case
  it's always DIKI_ALT_R, no matter if it's mapped to DIKS_ALTGR or DIKS_ALT.
  On standard keyboards it's also always the same hardware key code, no matter
  if you by a German keyboard with AltGr or a U.$. one with Alt.
- Changed the input core logic for keeping track of modifiers. If DIKI_ALT_R
  is pressed, also look at the symbol to decide if DIMM_ALT or DIMM_ALTGR is
  to be added/removed.
- Now application developers don't need to check for both DIKI_ALTGR and
  DIKI_ALT_R if they want to check for the key right next to the space bar :)

Software Rasterizer
- Almost completed support for Planar YUV formats (lacks colorkeying).
- Fixed Cb/Cr offset computation (height*pitch/4 is different from
  height/2*pitch/2 if height is odd).

libdirect
- Made debug/release versions binary compatible, being able to link
  dynamically against both or even run in the same session.
- Added D_OOM() message if thread structure can't be allocated.
- Added D_MAGIC_SET_ONLY which is D_MAGIC_SET without assuming that the magic
  hasn't been set already. Useful to avoid compiler warnings when acting on
  uninitialized structures on the stack.
- Removed dependency on -D_GNU_SOURCE when including <direct/util.h>:
- Made direct_util_recursive_pthread_mutex_init() non-static-inline.
- Removed DIRECT_UTIL_RECURSIVE_PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER and replaced all
  of its occurences by PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER. These didn't need to be
  recursive. If there's a recursive mutex required, you can still use the
  utility function direct_util_recursive_pthread_mutex_init().
- Removed -D_GNU_SOURCE from direct.pc and directfb-config.
- Added DIRECT_SIGNAL_ANY as a replacement for the magic -1.
- If the debug domain being registered contains a slash, but didn't exactly match an entry
  in directfbrc, check to see if the domain is descended from an entry in directfbrc,
  e.g. 'ui/field/messages' matches 'ui' or 'ui/field'.
- New D_DEBUG_ENTER and D_DEBUG_EXIT to ease debug messages for tracing function calls.
- Added UDP support to DirectStream.
- Added symbol resolving support for static binaries.
- Replaced the enum based bool definition by a typedef to __u8.
- Defined false and true via macros like stdbool.h does.
- Allow NULL argument in direct_free().
- Thanks to Andy Stewart for fixing the hash table reallocation which didn't
  check for collisions during reinsertion.

libfusion
- Using the new Fusion Kernel API 2.0
- Parallel Fusion Worlds in one process via extended API
- Multiple Shared Memory Pools in one world via new API
- No race condition between (potential master) processes starting in parallel
- Fusion APIs have been extended to support different worlds and pools.
- Added fusion_reactor_sized_dispatch() to dispatch a message to any attached
  reaction with a given size. Instead of using the size defined by the reactor,
  the caller can specify the size of the data.
- Added a parameter to fusion_enter() - FusionEnterRole - to specify either
  FER_ANY, FER_MASTER or FER_SLAVE. If the world can't be entered playing the
  specified role, an error message is printed and DFB_UNSUPPORTED is returned.
- Added FusionCallExecFlags parameter to fusion_call_execute().
- Allow pending reactions (in local dispatcher queue) to be executed
  after the shared reactor part has been destroyed. This fixes for example
  occasionally missing DWET_DESTROYED events.

libvoodoo
- Avoid tons of warnings by using D_MAGIC_SET_ONLY instead of D_MAGIC_SET.
- More Requester/Dispatcher method implementations.

- Supports overlay on secondary head.
- Improved overlay RGB rendering.
- Improved R100/R200 3d functions performance.
- Fixed 2d/3d engines synchronization.
- Added support for surfaces stored in AGP memory.
- Use the POINT primitive to fill rectangles with size=1 (i.e. to draw points) [~60% faster].
- Speed up FillRectangle, Blit and StretchBlit by using the RECTANGLE_LIST primitive
  instead of QUAD_LIST [~15% faster]. :)
- Reset MC_FB_LOCATION to avoid problems with X (thanks to Michel Danzer).
- Check for integrated GPUs.
- When AGP support is enabled, turn off pci gart and turn on bus mastering.
- Added acceleration for AYUV, but color conversion is not supported because
  radeon supports AVYU instead of AYUV.

Matrox Driver
- Support for DSDRAW_SRC_PREMULTIPLY.
- Limited support for DSBLIT_SRC_PREMULTIPLY.
- PCI device ID cleanup.
- Fixed Mystique vs. Mystique 220 detection.
- Allow DSPF_ARGB surface for BES.
- Finally remove DLOP_FLICKER_FILTERING on CRTC2.
- Don't reinitialize the whole TV encoder when changing field parity.
- Disable BES if the destination region is completely off-screen.
- Allow surface height up to 2048 with DLOP_DEINTERLACING (BES).
- Limit surface width with DLOP_DEINTERLACING to guarantee BESPITCH < 4096.
- Disable vertical filtering when surface width > 1024 (BES).
- G200 BES doesn't support color adjustments.
- Don't touch hardware in SetRegion() if nothing changed (SPIC).
- Separated spic_calc_buffer() out of spic_set_buffer().
- Fixes for G100 with SDRAM.
- Fixed YUY2/UYVY and texture LUT state handling.
- Fixed color keying mask, G100 doesn't have TEXCTL2 so TEXTRANS
  must be used to disable color keying.
- Completely untested PPC support.
- Misc. cleanups.

Mach64 driver
- Added support for DSDRAW_SRC_PREMULTIPLY and DSBLIT_SRC_PREMULTCOLOR.
- Don't advertise DFXL_STRETCHBLIT when it hasn't been checked.

- Check the chip type in ovSetColorAdjustment().
- Enabled SCALE_Y2R_TEMP.
- Minor cleanup.

nVidia driver
- Added support for AGP
- Added support for DMA using AGP or Framebuffer memory.
- Finally fixed the "random-crashes-when-blitting-from-system-memory" problem.

Unichrome driver
- Fix hardware revision number detection and allow override via new config
  option unichrome-revision=<rev>.  The revision number can only be
  auto-detected if the process runs as root.
- Added simple script to determine revision number for addition to
  directfbrc.
- Added support for DLOP_FIELD_PARITY.  For this to work, the kernel
  framebuffer must support an extension of the WAITFORVSYNC ioctl that
  allows waiting for the top or bottom field.
- YV12, I420, YUY2 and AiRGB simple blits, AiRGB 2D drawing
- Disable broken SetColorAdjustment for the overlay and remove color keying diagnostic.
- Round to nearest when positioning up-scaled YV12/I420 video to reduce error.
- Fix YV12/I420 video layer corruption on revision 0x11 hardware. Also
  fix bug setting SUBP_CONTROL_STRIDE register in uc_spic_set_buffer.  Sadly
  subpicture layer still doesn't work.
- ARGB4444 as source and destination pixel format for all supported operations.
- Overhaul of LEVELS, OPACITY and primary ALPHACHANNEL features which were
  previously only partially implemented and did not work together.
- The video overlay and the primary layer now both support the OPACITY option
  and either can be on top.  The order is determined by the 'level' assigned
  to the video layer.  The primary also supports an alpha channel which is
  useful when the video layer is positioned behind.
- The old DFB_CLE266_UNDERLAY environment variable switch has been removed.

FBDev System module
- Added AGP support.

SDL System module
- Decoupled screen updates from Fusion Dispatcher.
  Updates are handled in a separate thread; they're accumulated rather than
  queued in case an update is already pending.
- Use the flag FCEF_ONEWAY to not wait for the call being executed,
  otherwise a deadlock could occur. The return value is meaningless anyways.
  Queued updates will be merged on the receiving side (master) to avoid a
  lag and improve performance.

Gunze Input driver
- Added Gunze Touchscreen driver, thanks to Nathanael D. Noblet <nathanael@gnat.ca>!

PenMount Input driver
- Added input driver for PenMount 9509 serial touchscreen.

PS/2 Input driver
- Applied patch from Christian Krause <krause.chr@gmail.com> that allows
  usage of the option "mouse-source" without "mouse-gpm-source".

dfbdump tool
- Show "1k" again for '0 < bytes < 1024'.

- Don't use fusion_reactor_free() too early in case of an error in init_devices().
  Thanks to "Jakub Bogusz <qboosh@pld-linux.org>" for this and other patches.
- IDirectFBVideoProvider::GetPos() returns DFB_EOF to notify end-of-playback.
  After stream has reached the end, the next call to PlayTo()
  restarts playback from the beginning.
- No need for <linux/wm97xx.h> and <linux/sisfb.h> anymore.
- Build all graphics drivers without checking for FB_ACCEL_* in <linux/fb.h>,
  because we have a fallback for each of those ids.
- Don't build cle266 by default as it's obsolete because of the unichrome driver.


0.9.23
------

  additional information like device and driver name, version etc.
- Added more enums to the autogenerated directfb_strings.h.
- Added errorcode DFB_EOF.
- Added DSBLIT_XOR.
- Added universal event class for custom usage with variable size. New structure DFBUniversalEvent
  has a 'clazz' and a 'size' member. The clazz is always DFEC_UNIVERSAL and the size is at least
  sizeof(DFBUniversalEvent). There are no other members, but any amount of additional data may
  follow according to the specified size. Best usage would be to derive from the struct.
- Added new input event flag DIEF_REPEAT indicating a repeated key or button press.
- Support fractional font sizes in DFBFontDescription.
- Added IDirectFBDataBuffer::CreateVideoProvider().
- Added IDirectFBDataBuffer::Finish(): used to notify a streaming databuffer that the end-of-file has been reached.

Graphics Core
- Added support for system to video memory blits in (semi-)hardware.
- Some 24bit big endian fixes, thanks to Mark Salter <msalter@redhat.com>!
- Added dfb_gfxcard_invalidate_state() which sets the state pointer to NULL
  and therefore forces a full SetState() before the next operation is executed.
- If the destination has premultiplied alpha do real Porter/Duff SRC_OVER
  composition for glyphs.
- Fixed build_clipped_rectangle_outlines() to handle special cases
  where width and/or height is/are one or two.

- Changed EnableCursor() to be allowed in exclusive mode, too.
- Added dfb_screens_hook_primary() using it in some drivers instead of dfb_screen_register_primary().
- During flip using blitting, wait for pending writes to the back buffer before issuing
  the blit command from back to front buffer to avoid lags caused by too much queued commands.

Windowing Core
- Support windows with premultiplied alpha by checking if their surface has DSCAPS_PREMULTIPLIED.

- Changed Bop_a8_set_alphapixel_Aop_argb() to be a fast path for real SRC_OVER
  DrawString() that uses DSBLIT_SRC_PREMULTIPLY and DSBLIT_BLEND_ALPHACHANNEL
  with SrcBlend = ONE and DstBlend = INVSRCALPHA. Other formats will follow.
- Fixed DSDRAW_SRC_PREMULTIPLY if used without blending.
- Implemented DSBLIT_SRC_PREMULTCOLOR.

Image Loading
- Premultiply image data when loading into premultiplied alpha surfaces.
- Limit number of weights to 64 in x and y direction for down scaling. Without this
  limitation down scaling to 1x1 or similar could take minutes on embedded platforms.
- If JFIF or Exif header detection failed, try detecting by filename extension.
- For PNGs with alpha don't always suggest DSPF_ARGB, but the primary layer format if it has alpha.

Font Loading
- If the font format is ARGB, use premultiplied font surfaces.

  the first item's "prev" pointer was not updated (pointing to the last element).
- Added low level logging abstraction. Added runtime options "log-file = <name>"
  and "log-udp = <host>:<port>" for configuring the default log. 
- Added direct_thread_set_name() for setting the name of threads that haven't been created by direct_thread_create().
- Added DirectStream, a wrapper for accessing files locally and through network (http, ftp and generic tcp).

libfusion
- Added fusion_object_get() that gets a pool and an object id and returns
  the appropriate object with a local reference added to it. If the object
  is not found DFB_IDNOTFOUND is returned, or any abnormal other error from
  locking or referencing.
- Added FusionObjectID to replace plain int usage.
- Fixed an evil dead lock that only occured by moving a window with one of my new mice,
  having superior precision generating lots of events, thanks for spotting this bug, Logitech :)

  used for colorizing, simply modulate the color values with the alpha,
  otherwise overwrite them.

nVidia
- Rewrite of the driver, following the structure of other drivers, e.g. Matrox.
- Overlay and blitting supports Deinterlacing.
- WaitForSync no longer burns the CPU (but actually requires a 2.6 kernel).
- Decide texture buffer size according to available video memory.

0.9.22
------

API
- Added DLCAPS_ALPHA_RAMP: Alpha values for formats with one or two alpha

  to specify any combination of the flags: DSCAPS_INTERLACED, DSCAPS_SEPARATED
  or DSCAPS_PREMULTIPLIED.
- Added DLCAPS_SCREEN_POSITION and DLCAPS_SCREEN_SIZE.
  These are set if DLCAPS_SCREEN_LOCATION is set and vice versa.

  2. SetVideoMode()
  3. mode= and pixelformat= options
  4. current layer config

API | IDirectFBDisplayLayer
- Added IDirectFBDisplayLayer::SetScreenPosition() which
  sets the position of the layer on the screen specified in pixels.
- Added IDirectFBDisplayLayer::SetScreenRectangle() which
  sets the position and size of the layer on the screen specified in pixels.

API | IDirectFBSurface
- Added IDirectFBSurface::SetAlphaRamp(a0,a1,a2,a3): Either all four values
  or the first and the last one are used, depending on the format.
  Default values are: 0x00, 0x55, 0xaa, 0xff.
- Added IDirectFBSurface::FillRectangles().

Build Options
- Added option "--with-inputdrivers=..." for selecting drivers to build,
  thanks to Marcel Siegert <mws@twisted-brains.org>!

Runtime Options
- Replaced "argb-font" and "a1-font" with a more flexible "font-format" option.

  these are used for StretchBlit() using YUY2 or UYVY.

Display Layer Core
- Keep a list of all realized (added) regions to remove them during
  emergency shutdown, e.g. signal received or missing deinit of master app.
- Added CLRCF_SURFACE_CAPS and field 'surface_caps' to CoreLayerRegionConfig
  in the display layer driver API.
- HW Windows created with DWDESC_SURFACE_CAPS and DSCAPS_PREMULTIPLIED
  in 'desc.surface_caps' are created as premultiplied layer regions.
- Store normalized and pixel based destination area in a layer context.
- Added CoreLayerLayoutMode which defines incorporation of
  configuration based size changes and destination area values.
- Activate the most recent context instead of the primary (shared) context
  when the current context is removed.
- Restore color adjustment when (re)activating a context.

Windowing Core
- Create layer regions for hw windows in single buffered mode, unless
  explicitly configured using DSCAPS_DOUBLE/TRIPLE or DWCAPS_DOUBLEBUFFER.
  This is a preliminary solution, because by default a window surface should
  require a Flip() to make changes visible.

- Implemented hw window resizing.

libfusion
- Take the largest one, if multiple tmpfs are found.

Proxy Interface Implementations (Voodoo)
- Implemented BatchBlit() in IDirectFBSurface_Requester and _Dispatcher.

Fixes (excerpt)

  surface with multiple buffers is configured to have less, e.g. switching
  a layer from DLBM_TRIPLE/BACKVIDEO to DLBM_FRONTONLY.

dfblayer
- Show the layer level if supported.

Intel
- Added i830 driver (overlay support only) for Servision Ltd.
  (http://www.servision.net/)

- Added experimental support for NV30 chipsets.
- Found the way to make NVScaledImageFromMemory (used for StretchBlit,
  Alphablend, Color Conversion) work on NV20 chipset: it was another rivafb
  bug, therefore the rivafb-nv20fix-* patch is absolutely required.
- Added basic support for drawing with alphablend on NV20.
- Great performance improvements: it's possible to move a translucent window
  at 32bpp while the cpu stays idle.
- No longer return a surface stored in system memory for YUY2 and UYVY;
  return directly the video surface instead.
- Added FillRectangle() and Blit() (without effects) for YUY2 and UYVY.

- Added a lot of types for description and configuration of these components.
  (see the API Reference Manual for more details)

API | IDirectFBSurface

  of many small blits with same source and destination, e.g. custom font
  rendering like GTK+-DirectFB does.
- Preliminary depth buffer support using DSCAPS_DEPTH to allocate and use it,
  currently hard coded to 16 bit, only useful for TextureTriangles().
- Added DSFLIP_PIPELINE for advanced synchronization with the accelerator,
  currently implemented for Flip() on window surfaces. This feature is for
  accelerators with a command buffer that can store more graphics operations

  of the "UniQuE" window manager implementation.

Build Options
- Allow "--enable-static" and "--enable-trace" at the same time.
- Added "--enable-zlib" that activates gzipped screen shots etc.
- Added "--enable-voodoo", default is no.
- V4L2 has to be enabled explicitly via "--enable-video4linux2".
- Detect cygwin, default to static builds and don't require libdl.
- In static build mode, add an ".o" version of the ".a" module file.
  Applications can link statically against the ".o" files without having
  to specify an extra linker option for each module, e.g. "-Wl,-udirectfb_sdl".
- Applied patch from "Oskar Liljeblad <oskar@osk.mine.nu>"   
  which adds the configure option "--disable-sonypi-jogdial".
- Added "--disable-wm97xx" to disable WM97xx driver.
- With "--disable-gettid" one can enforce usage of getpid(),
  e.g. on broken systems where gettid() simply segfaults,
  though the system call is present in <linux/unistd.h>.
- Added "--enable-unique", disabled by default.

Pixel Formats
- Added DSPF_AiRGB, i.e. DSPF_ARGB with inverted alpha channel.
- Added DSPF_A1, e.g. for monochrome fonts.
- Removed DSPF_RGB15 in the flavor of DSPF_ARGB1555.
- Added DFB_COLOR_BITS_PER_PIXEL(format), DFB_ALPHA_BITS_PER_PIXEL(format)
  and DFB_PIXELFORMAT_INV_ALPHA(format).
- Added DFB_PIXELFORMAT_ALIGNMENT(format) which is non-zero if alignment
  is required to do byte aligned access, e.g. 7 for DSPF_A1.
- Added DSPF_NV12 (planar YUV).
  (8 bit Y plane followed by one 16 bit quarter size CbCr [15:0] plane)
- Added DSPF_NV16 (planar YUV).
  (8 bit Y plane followed by one 16 bit half width CbCr [15:0] plane)

System
- Use gettid() instead of getpid() if available.

Graphics Core
- Minimize state changes during text drawing.
- Drivers can choose between byte/pixel pitch alignment, or even use both.
- Added convenience macros and inline functions for setting state members.
- Added CoreGraphicsSerial storing the "serial" of a certain graphics operation.
- Added GetSerial() and WaitSerial() to the graphics driver API:
  GetSerial() returns the serial of the last queued graphics operation.
  WaitSerial() waits until the operation with the specified serial is finished.
- Store the serial of the most recent accelerated graphics operation that has
  been queued for writing to a surface buffer.
- dfb_layer_region_flip_update() is no longer waiting for an idle accelerator, 
  if the buffer that is becoming the front has or had a write operation queued.
  Instead it waits exactly for the last operation that is or was about to write
  to this buffer. If WaitSerial() is not supported by the driver and/or hardware,
  the fallback, of course, is to wait for each and every operation to finish.
- Wait for only the last write operation queued for a buffer,
  if the software needs to access it.
- Speed up tiled blitting by clipping in advance.
- Implemented software clipping for hardware accelerated DrawRectangle().
- Use hardware accelerated FillRectangle() if DrawRectangle() is not accelerated.
- Removed the surface listeners attached by dfb_state_set_destination() and  
  dfb_state_set_source().
- Added dfb_state_update() which does the work of the removed listeners
  if direct_serial_update() returns true. Updating the source is optional.
  Only surfaces set via dfb_state_set_*() are handled.
- Use dfb_state_update() in dfb_gfxcard_state_acquire() and gAcquire().
- Added parameter "write_front" to dfb_surface_flip_buffers() which is useful  
  for triple buffering. If true, the new back buffer will be the front buffer. 
  Drivers should detect if the current front buffer is not being shown already,
  in which case the idle buffer might be still shown and should not be written.
- Added "__u32 dfb_color_to_aycbcr( const DFBColor *color )".

Display Layer Core
- Refactored display layer core.
- Added contexts along with regions allocated within them.
- Drivers are only aware of regions. Usually a driver supports one region
  per layer. Hardware windows are implemented via hardware regions.

Input Core
- Added dfb_input_add_global() and dfb_input_set_global() to register global 
  reactions at run time, e.g. from another library or module in which case the   
  static reaction table can't be initialized with the address of those functions.
- Cleaned up input core code, e.g. by replacing the "inlined" singly linked list
  code by using a "DirectLink" and the "direct_list_*()" functions, or by adding
  usage of D_MAGIC_ASSERT() etc.

Windowing Core
- Pressing <Meta>-<Ctrl> + Left/Right Click generates 3rd/4th button event.
- Switch to color keyed cursor if shape doesn't have alpha or if translucent
  windows are disabled.
- Changed <Meta>-'S' to raise the lowest window, e.g. to revert a <Meta>-'A'.
- Added <Meta>-<Escape> to switch from fullscreen mode to the desktop.
  (currently not advisable if a flipping fullscreen app is still rendering)
- Modularized window management for different implementations on desktop
  and embedded systems.
- Added new experimental window manager "UniQuE" with window decorations.
- Added a CoreWindowConfig containing position, size, opacity, stacking,
  options, events, color key and opaque region.

Software Driver
- Added DSBLIT_DEINTERLACE support to gBlit.
- Implemented missing blending modes.
- Implemented lots of missing format specific code.
- Implemented stretchblitting for YUV.
- Fix a8 font rendering for argb1555, i.e. remove alpha pits around glyphs.
- Replaced gDrawLine() by gFillRectangle() in rectangle outline drawing code.
- Allocate accumulators dynamically.
- Lots of optimizations and fixes.

Debugging Support
- Major speed up by using thread specific data instead of gettid().
- Use popen("nm -n ...") to load symbols of any module on demand.
- Show static symbols in stack traces.
- Produce gdb like stack dumps (output formatting).
- Added thread names to debug output, stack traces etc.
- Added interface instance tracking in debug mode, showing remaining
  instances at exit time (like it's done for allocated memory).
- Added debug domains which can be enabled/disabled separately.
- Added "<Meta>-<BackSpace>" debugging shortcut for
  dumping the stack of each thread of the master process.
- Align debug output of domains.
- Indent debug output if trace support is enabled
  by using direct_trace_debug_indent() which sets the flag TF_DEBUG for the
  current frame and returns the current debug message indention level by
  examining the stack, counting any upper frames that produced debug output.
- Added tons of assertions and assumption, mostly to new code.
- Added support for A8,YUY2 and UYVY surfaces in dfb_surface_dump().

Fixes (excerpt)
- No need to call SetOpacity() before RequestFocus() for input only windows.
- Don't allow GetWindow() on the cursor window.
- Don't wait for Fusion Dispatch Thread during emergency shutdown.

  to synchronize time stamps of debug messages.
- Added a minimalistic hash table implementation for usage with IDs as keys.
- Added DirectResult which is the DFBResult outside of DirectFB.
- Added message macro D_UNIMPLEMENTED which prints a warning once.
- Added a name argument to direct_thread_create(),
  printed during creation and termination of threads.

  and direct_thread_self_name().
- Added DIRECT_UTIL_RECURSIVE_PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER.
- Added direct_list_append() and changed the list structure to have
  the first element's 'prev' pointing to the last element of the list.
- Added DirectThreadInitHandler which can be installed/uninstalled using   
  direct_thread_add_init_handler() and direct_thread_remove_init_handler().
  The registered init handler function is called at the beginning of new threads.
- Allow per file debug mode forcing via definition of DIRECT_FORCE_DEBUG.
- Added D_DERROR(ret,message) which acts like D_PERROR(message), but takes
  a DirectResult (DFBResult) instead of using errno.
- Added D_ARRAY_SIZE(array) to calculate the size of an array.
- Added D_FORMAT_PRINTF(n) to check the format of (debug) messages.
- Added flag manipulation macros D_FLAGS_*.
- Added D_CONST_FUNC to declare const functions.
- Added DirectSerial providing a 64 bit serial number with functions
  for initialization, increasing, copying and updating.
- Added D_DEBUG_ENABLED which is defined depending on three other macros.
  It's defined to be 1, if the D_DEBUG* macros produce code. Useful for
  embracing code that is just required for the debugging output.
- Added D_OOM() which prints the warning "out of memory" and gives
  DFB_NOSYSTEMMEMORY if used as a (return) value.
- Added D_OOSHM() which is the same as D_OOM() in single app build.
  Only in multi app build it prints the warning "out of shared memory"
  and gives DFB_NOSHAREDMEMORY if used as a (return) value.
- Renamed direct_list_contains() to direct_list_contains_element_EXPENSIVE()
  to ensure that developers know that they shouldn't use it in non-debug code.
- Added direct_list_count_elements_EXPENSIVE().
- Added direct_util_count_bits(), slow version,
  but at least optimized for bit sets with lower bits set only.

libfusion
- Migrated Fusion into a separate library to be used without DirectFB,
  e.g. using FusionSound without initializing DirectFB.
- Added fusion_object_globalize() doing the often used combination of
  fusion_object_link() and fusion_object_unref(), i.e. increasing the global
  reference counter and decreasing the local reference counter.
- Removed FusionResult using DirectResult instead.
- Use new Fusion API for entering the world (including version checking).
- Added fusion_ref_inherit() using the new ioctl FUSION_REF_INHERIT.
- Added fusion_object_inherit() to inherit the local reference count
  from another object of any type.
- Added "docs/ReferenceMaps.txt" which explains references
  and visualizes different cases of inter object referencing.
- Heavily cleaned up code of FusionReactor and added lots of debug messages and
  comments. You should add "no-debug = fusion/reactor" to disable these loads
  of debug messages, while still showing other messages if "debug" is used.
- Cleaned up FusionObject code and debug messages.
- Added some assertions and assumptions to the shared memory code.
- Added a parameter to fusion_skirmish_init() and fusion_reactor_init() to  
  set the name of the skirmish or reactor using the ioctl FUSION_ENTRY_SET_INFO.
- Don't create a skirmish for each reactor's global reactions, but use a single
  skirmish for all reactors which is created during Fusion's initialization.
- Added fusion_reactor_set_lock() to use another skirmish for the global
  reactions of the reactor.
- Added fusion_object_set_lock() to set the skirmish for the global reactions
  of the object's reactor, while default is the skirmish used to lock the pool.

  channel or a color key are ignored if the pixel under the cursor is completely
  transparent. Thanks to Monge Maurizio <monge@sns.it>!
- Added IDirectFBEventBuffer::WakeUp() causing any WaitForEvent() or
  WaitForEventWithTimeout() to return with DFB_INTERRUPTED.
- Added new display layer buffer mode DLBM_WINDOWS where the layer itself
  has no surface, but the hardware is aware of each window and displays
  the window stack. Added DLCAPS_WINDOWS, too.
- Added <Meta>-<Print> hot key to make a screenshot of the focused window
  including its alpha channel if present. Creates a ppm (RGB) and a pgm (alpha).
  Use "pnmtopng -alpha foo.pgm foo.ppm > foo.png" to combine them.
- Added IDirectFBSurface::Dump() similar to <Meta>-<Print>, see above.

  It's pretty well working already, though there are some minor issues left.
- Added support for multiple multi application worlds with new option
  "session=<num>" selecting the multi application world being joined or created.
  VT switching between multiple DirectFB sessions rocks!

  window's event queue. The event dispatcher thread can then decide to close it.
- Added 'IDirectFBWindow::Destroy()' which actually destroys the window after
  sending a 'DWET_DESTROYED' event, so the event dispatcher thread can notice
  and release any interfaces belonging to it.
